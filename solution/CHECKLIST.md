Hi Nola Team,

I'm submitting my solution for the God Level Coder Challenge.

Repository: [GitHub URL]
Demo Video: [YouTube/Vimeo URL]
Live Demo: [Deployment URL] (optional)

Summary:
I built a complete analytics platform for restaurant owners using React,
TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. The solution includes
authentication, interactive dashboards with multiple chart types, advanced
filtering, dark mode, AI-powered insights, CSV export, and comprehensive
documentation with automated testing.

Key features:
- Full-stack TypeScript application
- RESTful API with 15+ endpoints
- Interactive charts using Recharts
- Real-time filtering by date, channel, and store
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Dark mode with smooth transitions
- AI-powered insights (7 insight types)
- CSV data export functionality
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Automated testing (17 backend + 6 frontend tests)
- Production-ready with deployment guides

Technical highlights:
- Type-safe development (TypeScript + Prisma)
- Performance optimized (parallel API calls, database aggregations)
- Comprehensive documentation (7 markdown files + TESTING.md + DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
- Docker setup for easy local development
- Test coverage with Jest and Vitest
- Infrastructure as Code (render.yaml, vercel.json)

The solution is fully functional and ready to deploy.

Thank you for the opportunity!

Best regards,
